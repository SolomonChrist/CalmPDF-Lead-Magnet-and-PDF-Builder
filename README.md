# CalmPDF Lead Magnet Builder

A modern, quiet, and frictionless web application for creators, consultants, and marketers to build professional Lead Magnet PDFs. 

### Vision
Creating a lead magnet should feel like moving paper on a desk—tactile, visual, and calm. This tool eliminates the complexity of PDF editors, providing a simple drag-and-drop interface for combining assets into a single cohesive document.

### Key Features
- **Visual Reordering:** Drag and drop pages to change the sequence of your PDF.
- **Multi-Source Support:** Upload both individual images (JPG/PNG) and multi-page PDFs.
- **Smart Splitting:** Uploaded PDFs are automatically exploded into individual pages for total layout control.
- **Marketing Page Generator:** Add a customizable call-to-action page at the end of your document.
- **Local-First Privacy:** All processing happens in your browser. Your files never leave your device.
- **High-Resolution Export:** Professional quality output ready for distribution.

### How it Works
1. **Upload:** Drop your images and existing PDF content into the upload zone.
2. **Arrange:** Drag the paper-like cards into your preferred order. Use rotation and preview tools to perfect the layout.
3. **Customize:** Toggle the Marketing Page to add your brand colors, headline, and call-to-action.
4. **Export:** Name your file and download your combined lead magnet with one click.

### Privacy Statement
CalmPDF is committed to user privacy. We do not use servers to process your documents. Your data is handled entirely in the client-side execution context of your browser. No trackers, no analytics, no cloud uploads.
