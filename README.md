# CalmPDF Lead Magnet Builder, A Quiet PDF Builder for Lead Magnets

**CalmPDF Lead Magnet Builder** is an open-source, minimalist, local-first web app for creators, consultants, and marketers who want to build beautiful lead magnet PDFs without the chaos of traditional PDF tools.

How did I come up with the name? I wanted the experience to feel calm, quiet, and frictionless, like moving paper on a desk. So, CalmPDF.

**NOTE:** This was a Vibe Coded project using Google Gemini and ChatGPT for prompting by **Solomon Christ**, and updates are the responsibility of community contributors.
